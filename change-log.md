#### Version 2, March 2017

This version is not backward compatible. Export your data and then
delete local data before loading the page with the new version. If
this is not done, it will be impossible to access old data.

The breaking change was made in order to store different kind of
information in the user's data, so that day boundaries can be easily
implemented.
