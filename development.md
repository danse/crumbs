#### Doctests

The code in `fun.js` is doctested. This means that the comments are
also actual tests. [Doctest](https://github.com/davidchambers/doctest)
is pretty cool, check it out!

You can test `fun.js` like this:

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/doctest fun.js 

#### Purescript

I am slowly migrating at least the business logic to Purescript. There
is a shell script to update the part of the code that is generated
from Purescript

#### App Cache

The manifest here is still maintained manually

#### Deployment

See the [deployment notes](deployment.md)
