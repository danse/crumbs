This is a minimalistic timetracker. **The space provided to you for
the log message will depend on the amount of elapsed time**. This will
make easier to get some sense out of the resulting report.

You can write more than the provided space, anyway, it's just a
suggestion. But the extra text will be grayed in order to give more
sense of the actual quantity when you are reading.

You can close or reload the page, the current counter is reset, but
the log remains.

The **crumbs** button will delete all the logs. Don't be too attached
to your personal recordings!

I'm running this on Chrome, but Firefox should go fine, as well.

### Hashtag reports

You can prefix any word with an hash (`#`) sign making an hashtag, like in
`#myticket`, like in twitter. When you'll hover on that word, a sum of all the
time tagged with it will be shown.
