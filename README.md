This is a minimalistic timetracker. The space provided to you for the log
message will depend on the amount of elapsed time. This will make easier to get
some sense out of the resulting report.

I'm running this on Chrome, but Firefox should go fine, as well.

### Hashtag reports

You can prefix any word with an hash (`#`) sign making an hashtag, like in
`#myticket`, like in twitter. When you'll hover on that word, a sum of all the
time tagged with it will be shown.
